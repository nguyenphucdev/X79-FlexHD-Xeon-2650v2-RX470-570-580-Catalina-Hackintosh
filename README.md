## X79/LGA2011 Hackintosh Catalina EFI for E5-2650 & RX460 RX470 RX570 RX580.

Fork or star, it's your call. You need to modify a lot if your system specs are different. I use an Ant Country Chinese motherboard. Very similar to FLEXHD x79 or Huanan X79. You can refer to this guide if you've a Huanan X79.

Also note that I've set my system memory info within the SMBIOS in clover. You should edit that.


## What Doesn’t Work?

- Sleep/wake
- FaceTime/iMessage (maybe, haven't tested yet though)


## Post USB preparation
1. Visit this https://youtu.be/xf7VEL-swcM for step by step tutorial in Vietnamese.
2. Use Clover Configurator (macOS) or DiskGenius (Windows) to mount the EFI folder within USB installer. 
3. Paste my folder to the EFI partition.

## Prepare motherboard for macOS installation

- Disable Secure Boot
- Disable Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT)
